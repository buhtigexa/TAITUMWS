Conjunto de Web Services ( geolocalización, email, DB) para buscar alquileres por diferentes criterios


Set of Web Services (geolocation, email, DB) to search for rents by different criteria 
The final work of the subject consists of the development of a RPC style web service. 
For the development of the service, a precise set of alternative categories has been provided as a guide,
given the freedom of choice over the functionality of the project, 
the service in question arose as a combination of these. Taitum (time to move!)
Is the web service object of study in this report. 

Taitum is intended to facilitate and reduce the valuable time required by the search process of a property.
Currently, and for the sake of simplicity, 
Taitum offers: 

• Register notices of real estate for rent / sale. •
Simple searches on housing metadata, also searches for proximity to an address (street, height, city, etc.). 

• Register searches with notification by email in case of a coincidence. 

• Simple statistical reports on registered offers
